### Scope

The Cancer Common FHIR Implementation Guide provides a **common cancer model** and guidance on how it can be represented using the HL7® FHIR® standard.

### Purpose

This project aims to define a **minimal, extensible, non-exhaustive European cancer data set** that is:

- Agnostic to the type of cancer  
- Usable across different use cases  
- Leveraging experiences of European projects working with primary and secondary usage  
- Taking into account the availability and usability of reliable data in EHR systems  

The guide is intended to be:  

- **Inclusive and cross-cutting** – transversal to different cancer domains and purposes of use  
- **Community-driven** – considers the needs of different communities  
- **Incremental** – start with a minimal core set, extend/enhance the model in later iterations  
- **FHIR-ready** – designed for facilitating representation using HL7 FHIR  

### Relationships and References

This project will build on the work of:  

- **mCODE** (as reference, not dependency)  
- **European funded projects**: PanCareSurPass, FLUTE, IDEA4RC  
- **Osiris**  
- **MEDOC**  

### Example Scenarios
- A multidisciplinary cancer team retrieves cancer-related data to assess the current diagnosis
- Cancer data is stored in a research warehouse for use in various research projects
