A patientâ€™s cancer journey is a longitudinal sequence of events that starts with presentation and evidence gathering, continues through condition assertion and staging, proceeds to treatment (often in overlapping episodes), and is followed by ongoing assessment of response and disease status. Capturing **dates** consistently for each step is essential so the timeline can be accurately reconstructed for care and research.
