A patient’s cancer journey is a longitudinal sequence of events that starts with presentation and evidence gathering, continues through condition assertion and staging, proceeds to treatment (often in overlapping episodes), and is followed by ongoing assessment of response and disease status. Capturing **dates** consistently for each step is essential so the timeline can be accurately reconstructed for care and research.

### 1. **Initial Entry into Care**

* The journey starts with **Symptoms / Screening** that lead the patient to seek medical attention.
* The first formal step is an **Initial Visit**, where the patient is evaluated and initial data (e.g., basic demographics, initial concerns) are captured.

---

### 2. **Clinical Assessment and Diagnostic Work-up**

* After the initial visit, the patient undergoes a **Clinical Assessment**.

  * Key data elements recorded include:

    * **Patient information**
    * **Cancer Condition** (suspected or confirmed)
    * **Cancer Stage** (if available or preliminary)
* The clinician then proceeds to **Order Procedures** for further investigation.

**Procedures ordered may include:**

* **Imaging** (e.g., CT, MRI, PET)
* **Laboratory Tests**
* **Biomarker studies**
* **Biopsy**
* **Surgery** (diagnostic or therapeutic)

---

### 3. **Diagnosis**

* Results from the ordered procedures feed into the formal **Diagnosis** step.
* At this point, the following data are typically updated:

  * **Patient** record
  * **Cancer Condition** (confirmed diagnosis)
  * **Cancer Stage** (based on established staging criteria)

---

### 4. **Treatment Planning**

* A formal **Treatment Plan** is created, including:

  * **Intent Definition** (e.g., curative, palliative)
  * **Target Site** (tumor location)
  * **Start Date** and **End Date** for treatment
* Treatments may consist of:

  * **Surgery**
  * **Radiotherapy**
  * **Drug Administration** (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy)
  * **Active Surveillance** (for cases where immediate intervention is not required)

---

### 5. **Follow-up and Response Assessment**

* After treatments begin or after a treatment cycle completes, the patient enters a **Follow-up** phase.
* **Follow-up Visits** are scheduled (via a **Follow-up Timer**).
* During these visits, data are collected:

  * **Evidence** (e.g., imaging, biomarker results)
  * **Treatment Response Type**
  * Updated **Patient**, **Cancer Condition**, and **Cancer Stage** information
* A **Response Assessment** is performed to evaluate:

  * Whether the disease is **stable**, **progressing**, or responding **positively** to treatment.

---

### 6. **Decision Based on Response**

Depending on the outcome of the response assessment:

* If the response is **positive** and disease is stable:

  * Move to **Continue Monitoring**.

* If there is **progression** of the disease:

  * Options include:

    * **Adjust Treatment** (e.g., switch therapies)
    * **Palliative Care** if disease is advanced or refractory.

* If the disease status is **terminal**:

  * The care focus shifts toward **End of Life** care.

---

### 7. **Disease Evolution**

* At each decision point, the patient’s **disease status** (e.g., stable, progression, terminal) determines the next steps in the journey.
* The cycle of **treatment → follow-up → response assessment** may repeat until either long-term stability is achieved or the disease progresses to a terminal stage.
