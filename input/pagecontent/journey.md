A patient's cancer journey is a longitudinal sequence of events that starts with presentation and evidence gathering, continues through condition assertion and staging, proceeds to treatment (often in overlapping episodes), and is followed by ongoing assessment of response and disease status. Capturing **dates** consistently for each step is essential so the timeline can be accurately reconstructed for care and research.
The following figure describes, at a high level, the overall process.

How to read the example above

- Time flows left to right; each milestone is anchored by a date.
- Icons/colors group events by type (e.g., diagnostic, staging, treatment, follow-up).
- Callouts summarize key data captured at each step (who, what, when, result).
- Arrows indicate possible loops (e.g., further evidence, additional treatment, recurrence).


A more structured view of this example is documented in the following sections.

### Overall journey

This diagram shows the main phases of the cancer journey
and indicates during which phases information is collected. It also highlights
the handoffs between clinical events and clinical documents, and where core
data (dates, codes, results, staging, responses) is expected to be available.

### Data Collection per step

#### From diagnosis to first follow-up
<div>
  <p></p>
<figure>
    {% include CancerJourneyData1.svg %}
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4: the cancer journey: from diagnosis to first follow-up</strong></figcaption>
</figure>
  <p></p>
</div>

Key data captured in this phase

- Presentation and evidence dates; type of evidence (imaging, pathology, labs) and results.
- Condition assertion: primary site, histology, behavior; assertion/confirmation date.
- Staging: scheme/version (e.g., AJCC), stage group and date; staging basis.
- Initial management plan and intent; care team and performing organization.
- First follow-up appointment date and any early assessment of response.

#### From first follow-up to first drug treatment

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5: the cancer journey: from first follow-up to first drug treatment</strong></figcaption>
</figure>
  <p></p>
</div>

Key data captured in this phase

- Treatment decision date and modality (surgery, radiation, systemic).
- Surgical details (if applicable): procedure, site, margins, path results and dates.
- Radiation (if applicable): plan, modality, dose/fractions, start date.
- Systemic therapy plan: regimen/agents, line of therapy, intent, planned start date.
- Follow-up assessments: clinical status, imaging/lab updates, ECOG/PS if used.

#### From first drug treatment to patient death

<figure>
    {% include CancerJourneyData3.svg %}
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6: the cancer journey: from first drug treatment to patient death</strong></figcaption>
</figure>
  <p></p>
</div>

Key data captured in this phase

- Systemic treatment administration: start/stop dates, cycles, dosing changes, holds.
- Response evaluations (e.g., RECIST): assessment date and outcome (CR/PR/SD/PD).
- Adverse events: dates, grade/severity, relationship to treatment, actions taken.
- Progression/recurrence events: date, site/pattern, basis of determination.
- Subsequent lines of therapy and outcomes; death date and, if available, cause.
